# Strategy 1: Examining distributional assumptions

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(readr)
coildata <- coildata <- read_csv("Data/coildata.csv")
```

## Testing Univariate and Multivariate Normal Distribution Assumptions

The evaluation of these assumptions is relatively straightforward through exploratory data visualization of kernel density plots and the Henze-Zirkler test implemented in the R package MVN

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

coildata_long <- reshape2::melt(coildata)

ggplot(coildata_long, aes(x = value, fill = variable)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~variable, scales = "free", ncol = 5) +
  theme_minimal() +  # Optional: Customize the theme
  labs(title = "Statistical distributions of observed variables")

library(MVN)
mvn(coildata)
```
